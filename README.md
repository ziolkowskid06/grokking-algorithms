Grokking Algorithms is a disarming take on a core computer science topic and shows readers how to apply common algorithms to practical problems faced in the day-to-day life of a programmer. It starts with problems like sorting and searching and builds up skills in thinking algorithmically. Then it tackles more complex concerns such as data compression or artificial intelligence.
